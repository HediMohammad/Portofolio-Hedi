      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
       In the Field Observation Practice program, I served as the of the <strong>Public Relations Division</strong>, responsible for establishing and maintaining communication between the organizing team and external parties such as speakers, tourism destination managers, and partner institutions. I also managed the publicity strategy for the program before, during, and after the observation activities.

This role required strong interpersonal communication skills, negotiation abilities, and sensitivity in building professional relationships. I ensured that all external communication needs were fulfilled, including scheduling meetings, requesting observation permissions, and preparing documentation for reporting and social media publication purposes.
