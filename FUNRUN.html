      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
       In the Communication Fun Run event, I served as the Chief Executive <strong> (Event Leader)</strong>, overseeing the entire process from planning and execution to post-event evaluation. I coordinated all organizing divisions, including licensing, logistics, sponsorship, publicity, and technical operations on the event day.

As the leader, I ensured that each team carried out its duties on time and managed any issues that arose with quick and practical solutions. I also maintained strong communication with faculty supervisors and sponsors to ensure smooth operations and full support for the event.

This role required firm yet adaptable leadership, strong managerial abilities, and effective communication skills to ensure that all aspects of the event ran smoothly and delivered a meaningful experience for all participants.
