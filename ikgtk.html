      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
       As the Chief Executive <strong>(Event Leader)</strong>, I held full responsibility for planning, coordinating, and executing the entire series of activities. I led the organizing team, delegated tasks based on divisions, and ensured that every part of the program ran according to the timeline and objectives. I also served as the main liaison between the committee, academic advisors, sponsors, and participants.

This role required strong leadership, effective communication skills, and the ability to make quick and accurate decisions. I was actively involved in designing the event concept, resolving on-site challenges, and ensuring that every activity ran smoothly and delivered meaningful impact to all stakeholders.
